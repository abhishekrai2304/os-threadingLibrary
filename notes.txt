*****Many to One model*****
1)how to store & restore context.->setjmp, longjmp. Both are asynchoronous.
	a)setjmp:- To remember particular location in the code.
	b)longjmp:- jump to particular location in the code. 
setjmp & longjmp are more complicated, use the below functions instead, they make the life easy.
setcontext()
getcontext()
swapcontext()
makecontext()

2)how to do scheduling?
	learn SIGALRM handling for timer and scheduler & timer_create & timer_stop system calls.
3)

sigaction is more powerful than signal
